Next Steps:

    Further Optimization:
        Experiment with different window sizes or additional technical indicators.
        Explore more sophisticated Attention mechanisms or hybrid models (e.g., Bidirectional LSTM).

    Model Deployment:
        Deploy the model to make real-time predictions or integrate it into a trading strategy.
        Use platforms like TensorFlow Serving or convert the model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile applications.

    Continuous Learning:
        Update the model periodically with new data to maintain its predictive accuracy.
        Implement mechanisms for continuous retraining as new sentiment and price data become available.

    Advanced Evaluation:
        Incorporate additional metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) or directional accuracy.
        Perform backtesting to assess how the model would perform in real trading scenarios.

    Incorporate Additional Data Sources:
        Integrate other data sources such as macroeconomic indicators, blockchain metrics, or alternative sentiment data.
